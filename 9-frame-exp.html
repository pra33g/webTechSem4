        <h3>Frames</h3>
        <p>
<pre>
    HTML frames are used to divide your browser window into 
    multiple sections where each section can load a separate 
    HTML document. A collection of frames in the browser 
    window is known as a frameset. The window is divided into 
    frames in a similar way the tables are organized: into 
    rows and columns.
